# MNIST

Hand written digits recognition project.

The handwritten digits recognition with MNIST dataset is the “Hello World” problem in the fields of data science and machine learning. It is an amazing project to get started with in order to understand the processes involved in a typical data science project. To recognize the digits I implemented a Neural Network model using Deep Learning Framework Keras. Keras is a go-to tool to build deep learning models. 

Here are the steps that comprised the project:

1) Download the data and split the data into training and testing sets.
2) Clean the data and transform the data into a format that can be accepted by a model.
3) Build a model.
4) Train the model using the training dataset and track the model’s performance; Adjust hyperparameters if needed and train the model again.
5) Test the model on the test set.
6) Report the findings.
